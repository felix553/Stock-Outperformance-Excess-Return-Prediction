**Introduction**
The implementation of this machine learning training is done within the Python environment in Jupyter Notebook. 

The notebook and files in the zip document are designed to run from start to end in one go. 

However, for major sections such as those related to model training, you can simply run section 1 "Libraries", and then run the cells within section "5. Classification Model" and onward.
